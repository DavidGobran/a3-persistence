## Task Tracker 2.0

https://a3-david-gobran-nrubm.ondigitalocean.app

- the goal of the app is to have a task tracker with persistent storage and user accounts
- deploying to Digital Ocean was the hardest part
- what authentication strategy you chose to use and why (choosing one because it seemed the easiest to implement is perfectly acceptable)
- I used Water.css because I wanted something that worked out of the box with no configuration
  - I kept my existing CSS from A2 which centered everything and made the table look better

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: I hosted on Digital Ocean
- **Tech Achievement 2**: I got 100% on each Lighthouse test
